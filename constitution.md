## 14 Voting

### 14.1
Voting in all meetings shall be democratic, with a simple majority sufficing for the passage of a motion. All tied motions are passed to the president for the deciding vote. No proxy voting shall be permitted.

A motion may be moved in a general or committee meeting to put a motion to a secret ballot. The Chair, acting as the Returning Officer, shall then conduct the secret ballot and declare the result. The Returning Officer shall not cast a vote during the ballot.

### 14.2
Where a member of the Committee determines that a motion needs to be put to the Committee as a matter of urgency; and it would not be practicable to convene a meeting of the Committee to pass the proposed motion, then consent by a simple majority of the Committee, communicated in writing by each Committee member to the Secretary, will suffice to pass the motion.

2. Following the conclusion of the Executives ballots, the Returning Officer shall check to see if the Affirmative Action target prescribed in Section 5.2 has been met. 

	If the target has not been met, the Returning Officer will continue to conduct the General Committee ballots, noting the order of potential election of candidates, as well as the vote counts, for each position. If the target has still not been met, all General Committee ballots should use the following procedure:
    
	1. Using the vote counts, the Returning Officer shall check to see which ballots had a woman candidate who wasnâ€™t elected.

	2. For the ballot with the woman that was closest to being elected, this woman shall instead be elected.

	3. In the case of two female candidates from separate positions trying, the order that their position appears in Section 5.1.1 of the Constitution shall be taken into account, with the candidate whose position appears higher in that order being chosen.

	4. This procedure should continue until the Affirmative Action target has been met.
    
    If the target has still not been met, the Returning Officer will then declare vacant the number of General Committee positions not held by women required to meet the target in the reverse order of their appearance in Section 5.1.1 of the Constitution.

3. In a by-election called outside of an Annual General Meeting the Returning Officer is directed to check whether the composition of the committee including vacancies meets the Affirmative Action target prescribed in Section 5.2. Vacant positions donâ€™t count towards the Affirmative Action target.

	If the Affirmative Action target has not been met, after concluding Executive Committee ballots, the Returning Officer should conduct elections for all unfilled positions with ballots using the procedure outlined in Section 14.4.2.

## 15 Absentee Committee Members

## 16 Committee Member Impeachment

### 16.1
If it is deemed that a committee member should be stood down, by a motion of the committee, or a petition bearing the names of at least fifteen members, impeachment proceedings will take place against the nominated committee member. At the next general meeting or Annual General Meeting, a motion shall be put to impeach the committee member, provided that at least five academic days notice has been given to the membership and to the member concerned in writing. If this passed by a two thirds majority, that committee position will become vacant and a new election held immediately. The committee member to be impeached will be given at least five minutes to speak before the vote is taken.

## 17 Club Member Impeachment

### 17.1
If deemed by a motion of the committee, or a petition bearing the names of at least fifteen members, any member of the club can be expelled. The procedure is the same as for impeachment except that the result is the voiding of the persons membership.
