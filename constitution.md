3. Following the conclusion of the single-member ballots, the Returning Officer shall check to see if the Affirmative Action target prescribed in Section 5.2 has been met.

	If the target has not been met, the Returning Officer will continue to conduct the multi-member ballots, noting the order of election of candidates. Women candidates in a multi-member ballot will then be elected before other candidates, in the original order of election.

	If the target has still not been met, the Returning Officer will then declare vacant the number of positions remaining to meet the target.


4. In a by-election called outside of an Annual General Meeting, the Returning Officer is directed to check whether the composition of the committee excluding vacancies meets the Affirmative Action target prescribed in Section 5.2 before the commencement of the elections. If the Affirmative Action target is met excluding vacancies then no further action is required. If it has not been met excluding vacancies then the Returning Officer is directed to reserve vacancies for women to meet the Affirmative Action target.

	If the number of vacancies is less than the number of positions required to meet the Affirmative Action target, the Returning Officer will reserve all the vacant positions to be filled by women. If the number of vacancies is equal to or greater than the number of positions required to meet the Affirmative Action target, the Returning Officer will conduct the election of positions in the order that they appear in Section 5.1.1 of the Constitution. 

	Between electing positions, should a point be reached where the number of vacancies left equals the number of women required to meet Affirmative Action, the remaining positions should be filled by women. 

	The positions can then be opened to male committee members should no women nominate for the positions, with the existing committee member immediately vacating his/her position upon winning the election.

## 15 Absentee Committee Members

### 15.1
Any committee member absent from two consecutive committee meetings without due cause or previous apology may, at the committees discretion, be deemed to resign from her/his position by a motion of the committee.

## 16 Committee Member Impeachment

### 16.1
If it is deemed that a committee member should be stood down, by a motion of the committee, or a petition bearing the names of at least fifteen members, impeachment proceedings will take place against the nominated committee member. At the next general meeting or Annual General Meeting, a motion shall be put to impeach the committee member, provided that at least five academic days notice has been given to the membership and to the member concerned in writing. If this passed by a two thirds majority, that committee position will become vacant and a new election held immediately. The committee member to be impeached will be given at least five minutes to speak before the vote is taken.

## 17 Club Member Impeachment
